				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel" target=
				"_blank">Gregor Johann Mendel</a> (20 July 1822 – 6 January 1884) was a
				scientist, Augustinian friar and abbot of St. Thomas' Abbey in Brno,
				Margraviate of Moravia. Mendel was born in a German-speaking family in the
				Silesian part of the Austrian Empire (today's Czech Republic) and gained
				posthumous recognition as the founder of the modern science of genetics.
				Though farmers had known for millennia that crossbreeding of animals and
				plants could favor certain desirable traits, Mendel's pea plant experiments
				conducted between 1856 and 1863 established many of the rules of heredity,
				now referred to as the laws of Mendelian inheritance.</p>
				<p>Mendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants: plant height,
				pod shape and color, seed shape and color, and flower position and color.
				Taking seed color as an example, Mendel showed that when a true-breeding
				yellow pea and a true-breeding green pea were cross-bred their offspring
				always produced yellow seeds. However, in the next generation, the green
				peas reappeared at a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow. To explain this
				phenomenon, Mendel coined the terms “recessive” and “dominant” in reference
				to certain traits. (In the preceding example, the green trait, which seems
				to have vanished in the first filial generation, is recessive and the
				yellow is dominant.) He published his work in 1866, demonstrating the
				actions of invisible “factors”—now called genes—in predictably determining
				the traits of an organism.</p>
				<p>The profound significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the
				turn of the 20th century (more than three decades later) with the
				rediscovery of his laws. Erich von Tschermak, Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns,
				and William Jasper Spillman independently verified several of Mendel's
				experimental findings, ushering in the modern age of genetics.</p>
				<h3 class="subsubheading">Life and Career</h3>
				<p>Mendel was born into a German-speaking family in Hynčice (Heinzendorf 
				bei Odrau in German), at the Moravian-Silesian border, Austrian Empire (now 
				a part of the Czech Republic). He was the son of Anton and Rosine 
				(Schwirtlich) Mendel, and had one older sister, Veronika, and one younger, 
				Theresia. They lived and worked on a farm which had been owned by the 
				Mendel family for at least 130 years. During his childhood, Mendel worked 
				as a gardener and studied beekeeping. Later, as a young man, he attended 
				gymnasium in Opava (called Troppau in German). He had to take four months 
				off during his gymnasium studies due to illness. From 1840 to 1843, he 
				studied practical and theoretical philosophy and physics at the 
				Philosophical Institute of the University of Olomouc, taking another year 
				off because of illness. He also struggled financially to pay for his 
				studies, and Theresia gave him her dowry. Later he helped support her 
				three sons, two of whom became doctors.</p>
				<p>He became a friar in part because it enabled him to obtain an education 
				without having to pay for it himself. As the son of a struggling farmer, 
				the monastic life, in his words, spared him the "perpetual anxiety about 
				a means of livelihood." He was given the name Gregor when he joined the 
				Augustinian friars.</p>
				<h3 class="subsubheading">Experiments on Plant Hybridization</h3>
				<p>After initial experiments with pea plants, Mendel settled on studying
				seven traits that seemed to be inherited independently of other traits:</p>
				<ul class="centerlist">
					<li>Seed shape</li>
					<li>Flower color</li>
					<li>Seed coat tint</li>
					<li>Pod shape</li>
					<li>Unripe pod color</li>
					<li>Flower location</li>
					<li>Plant height</li>
				</ul>

				He first focused on seed shape, which was either angular or round. 
				Between 1856 and 1863 Mendel cultivated and tested some 28,000 plants, 
				the majority of which were pea plants (Pisum sativum). This study showed 
				that, when true-breeding different varieties were crossed to each other 
				(e.g., tall plants fertilized by short plants), one in four pea plants had 
				purebred recessive traits, two out of four were hybrids, and one out of 
				four were purebred dominant. His experiments led him to make two 
				generalizations, the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment, 
				which later came to be known as Mendel's Laws of Inheritance.</p>
